Hi! Welcome to my blog.

I'm LeSeulArtichaut, a French programming amateur and beautiful artichoke at times.

This blog is an experiment, where I will post resources about programming while
I personnaly learn new things, in an attempt to create learning resources as
accessible as possible. Because teaching is the best way to learn.
